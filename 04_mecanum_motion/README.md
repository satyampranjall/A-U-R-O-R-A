# Mecanum Motion and Kinematics

## Motion Model
Each wheel contributes a force vector. By controlling wheel speed and direction, the resultant vector defines the robot’s motion.

---

## Supported Motions
- Forward and backward translation
- Left and right lateral movement
- In-place rotation
- Diagonal motion

---

## Speed Control
PWM modulation is used to ensure smooth acceleration, reduce wheel slip, and protect mechanical components.
