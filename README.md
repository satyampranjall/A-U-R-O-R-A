**Autonomous Unmanned Racing Obstacle Robot Architecture**
# Autonomous Obstacle Racing Mecanum Robot

## Overview
This repository documents the complete design and implementation of an autonomous obstacle-racing robot based on a four-wheel mecanum drive system. The robot is capable of holonomic motion, real-time obstacle detection, and deterministic autonomous navigation.

The project is structured to ensure reproducibility, modularity, and scalability, making it suitable for competitions, academic evaluation, and further research.

## Objectives
- Autonomous navigation without external control
- Omnidirectional movement using mecanum wheels
- Reliable obstacle detection and avoidance
- Stable orientation during motion
- Modular hardware and firmware architecture

---

## System Summary
The robot consists of the following subsystems:
- Mechanical subsystem (chassis and wheels)
- Electronics and wiring
- Sensor acquisition and processing
- Motion and kinematics
- Control architecture
- Firmware
- Power management
- Autonomous behavior logic

Each subsystem is documented in a dedicated directory.
