# Mechanical Design

## Description
The mechanical subsystem forms the physical foundation of the robot. A rigid chassis combined with a four-wheel mecanum configuration enables holonomic motion while maintaining stability during dynamic maneuvers.

## Mecanum Wheel Configuration
Each wheel is mounted at a corner of the chassis with rollers angled at 45 degrees. Opposite wheels use mirrored orientations to allow lateral force vector generation.

## Design Principles
- Symmetrical motor placement
- Low center of gravity
- Rigid sensor mounting
- Clearance for obstacle detection sensors

---

## Advantages
- Zero turning radius
- Instant lateral movement
- High maneuverability in constrained environments
