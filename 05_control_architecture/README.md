# Control Architecture

## Control Flow
1. Sensor data acquisition
2. Data filtering
3. Decision making
4. Motion vector calculation
5. Motor actuation

---

## Control Characteristics
- Deterministic behavior
- No random motion
- Predictable response to obstacles

---

## Fail-Safe Handling
- Immediate stop on invalid sensor readings
- Orientation correction using IMU feedback
